DIRC based on PicoRV
======================================================
This is a temporary repo for DIRC with [PicoRV](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) support.
The demo is developed with [Vitis 2020.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2020-1.html) 
and [Ultra96v2 board](https://www.96boards.org/product/ultra96/).
The default Vitis does not include Ultra96v2 BSP. You can copy the ultra96v2 
under [BSP](./BSP).
