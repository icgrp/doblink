	        * maybe a distribution of ORCA: https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wed1200-2016-01-05-VectorBlox-ORCA-RISC-V-DEMO.pdf
	   * Clifford Wolf https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32
	        * by yosys author, so probably works with symbiflow
	   * Vex https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv
	        * runs linux
